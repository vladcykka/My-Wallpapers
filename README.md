# My-Wallpapers
This is a repo of wallpapers, which I intend to use as backgrounds for TWMs

I've taken certain wallpapers from a couple of artists I follow:
* [Thu Berchs](https://www.artstation.com/thuberchs)
* [Nicholas Baum](https://www.artstation.com/nbaumuk)
* [Justin Wentz](https://www.artstation.com/justinwentz)
* [DT's Wallpaper repo on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/wallpapers)
* And a couple of stills from movies I love, taken from Pinterest and Google images.
* I have also taken a wallpaper from [this](https://github.com/unix121/i3wm-themer) repo.
